## Tasks
to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

- Millenials tend to ride more on weekends, especially on Saturdays and peak hours are around 6 pm
- Generation Z also has peak days on weekneds and peak hours are around 2 pm
- Generation X peak ridership days is mostly mid-week and weekends and their peak hours is around 6 pm 
- Baby boomers tend to ride more on weekends and their peak hours are usually around 6 pm
- The generation with the most trip count are Millenials so it would make sense to place more bikes during the millenial peak hour of 6pm on weekends.
